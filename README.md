# **FoG Trigger Dataset**  

## **Description**  
The FoG (Freezing of Gait) Trigger Dataset contains images annotated with potential triggers that may contribute to Freezing of Gait in individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The dataset includes labeled examples of five key triggers:  
- **Floor Pattern Changes**  
- **Tight Turns**  
- **Narrow Passages**  
- **Distraction**  
- **Dual-Tasking**  

Each image is paired with ground truth labels and reasoning descriptions to facilitate research in explainable AI for FoG trigger detection. The raw images and labels can be found in the corresponding sub-folders with names indicating the location which images were captured. The entire data corpus in trainable format can be found in the all_labeled_dataset json file.
